# Shared images directory

This folder is the central media library for reusable images across the website.

## Attractions photos (used by `/location/`)

Replace the placeholder files in:

- `assets/images/attractions/is-arutas/`
- `assets/images/attractions/san-giovanni-di-sinis/`
- `assets/images/attractions/museo-cabras/`
- `assets/images/attractions/tharros/`
- `assets/images/attractions/mari-ermi/`

Each attraction supports multiple images (carousel):

- `*-01.svg` (placeholder) or final `*.jpg`/`*.webp`/`*.avif`
- `*-02.svg` (placeholder) or final `*.jpg`/`*.webp`/`*.avif`
- optional `*-03` and following files for extra carousel slides

## Recommended image specs (from your side)

For best SEO + performance + quality across desktop/mobile:

- **Format**: AVIF (best) or WebP; JPG fallback accepted.
- **Master size**: **2400 × 1350 px** (16:9) per image.
- **Minimum accepted**: **1600 × 900 px**.

## SEO image checklist

For every image you provide:

1. Use descriptive filenames (no `IMG_1234`).
2. Keep each attraction's images coherent with the section topic.
3. Ensure no watermarks/logos on photos.
4. Prefer unique original photos of the exact location.
